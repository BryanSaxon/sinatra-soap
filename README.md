# Sinatra::Soap â€” Under construction

Sinatra-soap gem makes task to create SOAP API really simple. Inspired by WashOut gem for Rails. But remember, the only reason why you should use SOAP is legacy code.


## Overview

In case of simplicity and quick first working release:
 
 - WSDL would not be generated
 - WSDL would not be checked
 - Response would be ```"#{soap_action}Response"``` and types would guessed.


## Usage

A classic application would work like that: 

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/soap'

soap "SomeAction" do |params|
  do_something_with_params # hash to be returned
end
```

A modular application would look like that:

```ruby
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/soap'

class SoapAPI < Sinatra::Base

  #remember to register extenstion if you are using modular style
  register Sinatra::Soap 

  soap "SomeAction" do |params|
    params # hash to be returned
  end
end
```
