# Sinatra::Soap â€” Under construction

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IvanShamatov/sinatra-soap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IvanShamatov/sinatra-soap) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/IvanShamatov/sinatra-soap.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/IvanShamatov/sinatra-soap) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sinatra-soap.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/sinatra-soap)

## Overview

In case of simplicity and quick first working release:
 
 - WSDL would not be generated
 - WSDL would not be checked
 - Response would be ```"#{soap_action}Response"``` and types would guessed.


## Usage

A classic application would work like that: 

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/soap'

set :wsdl_path, "/path/to/file"

soap "SomeAction" do |params|
  do_something_with_params # hash to be returned
end
```

A modular application would look like that:

```ruby
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/soap'

class SoapAPI < Sinatra::Base

  #remember to register extenstion if you are using modular style
  register Sinatra::Soap 

  set :wsdl_path, "/path/to/file"

  soap "SomeAction" do 
    params # hash to be returned
  end
end
```
